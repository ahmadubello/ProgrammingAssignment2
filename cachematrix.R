## The following code will create two functions; 
## First is the makeCacheMatrix fucntion, which creates a special "matrix", which is really a 
## list containing a function to:
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y){
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)

}


## Secondly, the cacheSolve fuction will get the inverse of the matrix created above.
## First, it returns the inverse of the matrix if it has already been computed from the cache, 
## otherwise, the inverse is computed, cached using the setinverse function, and returned.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)){
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
    
}
